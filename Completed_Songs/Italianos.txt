[INTRO]
[dark cinematic synths, eerie music box twinkle, menacing atmosphere]
(My time be valuable like Audemars Piguet)
(Tick tock, tick tock)
Better check my Audemars Piguet

[VERSE 1]
[aggressive flow, heavy 808s kick in, menacing delivery]
Feeling real antsy, looking elegant and snazzy
It’s hard to stop my choppa once that bitch start dancing
I am so romantic, albeit a bit pedantic
Have your girl take a seat on my dick, call her Chris Hansen
As psycho as Manson, damn son tragic
Keep talking and I’ll surgically remove your man bun with my automatic

[REFRAIN]
[vocal pitch drop, ominous]
Sit yo ass down son I’ve had it, peasants don’t talk to me
Lucky I haven’t yet made you incapable of walking
Plus I control how your hormones
Like I’m head of endocrinology

[VERSE 1 PART 2]
[flow switch, faster delivery, snare rolls]
Tell your moms to stop calling
She abhorrent not enthralling
Personally I found her entirely appalling
Ok, skip the pleasantries
This peasant bitch on her knees
After doing her job of slobbing my knob
She takes it in her starfish of the chocolate variety

[PRE-CHORUS]
[beat drops out, bass dip, shimmering twinkles, whispered menace]
Disposition is abominable, so diabolical
High probability I react sadistically
Statistically I shoved my hand up their ass
Use em like a sock puppet 13 inches deep
(My time is valuable like Audemars P)

[CHORUS]
[twisted pop trap melody, echo harmonies, heavy sub-bass, anthemic]
Scary Terry... he dress really fly tho
Luxuriously gaudy like them Italianos
Wearing a gold and black Day-Date a la Tony Soprano
Let’s leave on a high note, your life I let you keep it
Prevent future events finding yourself beneath these Ferragamo sneakers

[VERSE 2]
[beat switch-up, glitchy twinkles, sparse drum pattern, arrogant tone]
I recall a week ago approximately
I was dining and yachting, sipping Clicquot intoxicated
I know y’all waiting, to see em admonish me
Wait til I file my response, that shit is astonishing
Bada bing - what I say to the court is
A Brady violation alters the situation
And da facts ain’t as the state originally purported

[VERSE 2 PART 2]
[building aggression, layers added]
Kinda ironic they act so untowardly
Toward me considering their little illegal consortium
Yes, your honor, I have documentation supporting
As the day comes to close, I’m trying to split like lickety
Y’all can suck my dickity
That shit dismissed with prejudice so easily
Now I reveal the tisket to their tasket
Not even begun mentioning the aspect most beautiful
Down the line I will prevail on my motions for punitives
I’m an unstoppable lunatic

[BRIDGE]
[instrumental glitch, distant mania laughs, slow heavy rhythm]
(Scary... Terry...)
Looking so clean in my Vacheron Constantin
Put you on the receiving end of a shooting that’s critical
Spraying the nina while wearing a Glashütte Original

[CHORUS]
[Hard Reprise, maximum volume, heavy distortion on 808s]
Scary Terry... he dress really fly yo
So luxuriously gaudy like them Italianos
Wearing a gold and black Day-Date a la Tony Soprano
Let’s leave on a high note, your life I let you keep it
Prevent future events finding yourself beneath these Ferragamo sneakers

[OUTRO]
[eerie echoes, fadeout twinkles, spoken word, cold tone]
Someone hand me an Adderall
Your girl my collateral
Pay up with interest or else her brain splattered
Do it or don’t, I am satisfied with the latter
(Scary Terry... always heavy...)
[End]
