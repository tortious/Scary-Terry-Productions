[intro, talking shit] Locked & loaded, nicka
Scary Terry productions
Out here robbing all you nickas at gun pount, uh, come get some…
[verse]
Highly educated, overpaid excessively
True story, I don’t play when it comes to money
Got a severe case of not-fucking-around syndrome
That’s why my occupation, aside from being the boss, is a content creator
I just spend every day making money
to a degree many would objectively conclude to be inordinate
climbing up tax brackets like a little kid on a jungle gym
Fuck being humble, I prefer being  the opposite
Where I not only expect the best, I dem& it & ain't the least bit appreciative, looking for any reason to get aggressive, out here looking for trouble, promiscuous too, if it’s got a hole & looks like a bitch, I’ll fuck it without thinking twice
I suppose this is why people say I’m anal retentive,  a term I find hurtful & offensive
& since yall liberal nickas say words is violence I figure I’d join the b&wagon
But instead of complaining I brought my iron with me & just began shooting
Ratataatatatatatatatatatata 
echoing all throughout the gymnasium
Now no matter what retarded color they had in their hair
guarantee there’s red in it now
While I’m finishing this verse up & collecting the wallets & purses 
from these recently deceased victims of mine I just shot up
Call my assistant & tell him code sadism, repeat, code sadism, then hang up the phone
Homeboy there in 5 with a change of clothes, clean up crew
& a car that we dispose of upon dropping me off at the crib
Grab a shower, burn the clothes homie gave me earlier in the fire place
Fucking fabulous cologne thrown on
Cuz I got people coming over in 20 for a dinner party
What you call psychopathy, I call Tuesday
Here’s a free piece of advice Compartmentalization is a useful technique, so fucking use it.
 
[chorus]
Straight beezlebub evil
Bee-bee-beezle, beezle,
Beezlebub evil, nicka
Scary Terry productions
He extremely violent cuz he aint got feelings, nah he sans empathy
Oh shit, I think I hear him
Best run… cuz he coming 
 
[verse]
Scary Terry productions, an obvious front company
Used as a means of obfuscating the true nature business, cuz that shit illicit & illegal as fuck
Breaking nickas noses with the butt of my pistol if I they speak out of turn
I run a right ship, & the only reason they put up with it is cuz I pay 150% better than my adversaries, & money talks nicka
I’m quick to anger & a reputation for being overly violent, even when it ain’t necessary
Yet I’m the big boss man so I take my time & don’t raise my voice
Cuz wealth whispers
Hence why I’m dismissive to you peasants
Only say excuse you & never saying pardon cuz I don’t beg for anything
Cuz I’m a psychopath with deep-rooted insecurities regarding not having enough
That’s why I only purchase the best
My wealth may be generational but I plan to try spending it all anyway
To hell with my heirs, let em earn their own way
I got so many different homes, penthouses, apartments & beach houses
Saying nuh uh, honey, I ain’t trying kiss ya
So go ahead & send ya lips a little south
Just like all those flocks of birds do the winter
Hmm, yes bitch, much better
 
[repeat chorus]
 
[verse]
I got trap houses all over Chicago 
Armed mercenaries outside, head on a swivel
Just itching to shoot at nickas cuz I dole out hella bonuses for each addition to the head count
Plus, the dudes killing on behalf of scary Terry just shows their commitment
I’m am observant employer & always aim to promote from within
Taking a big hit off the joint & then I hold it, coughing it out like a motherfucker
Got me weezing & I aint talking bout weezy F baby, nor 2 Pokémon evolving
Dwayne Carter cool as fuck, but ain’t got shit to do with it, where my phone at?
Call up my assistant, tell him to scoop a couple bitches
& then hurry & pick me up via my Maybach down at the pffoce
Upon arriving, I pay him a compliment
That in a world full of fucking retards
You’re only a little stupid
Wry smile briefly crosses his face as he say thank you sir
Good kid, he’s going places, & he gets my sick sense of humor
Or at least puts up with it & has convinced me he finds it funny
Even better if it’s the latter case cuz that means he already proficient in bullshitting
Now he just gotta up his code switching game & he’ll rise through the ranks in No time
Anyway, I tell him as much
& that I’m fucking starving
As such, off to little Italy goes scary terry 
vis-a-vis my henchman, my Machbach he whipping, 
while I’m in the backseat with a gaggle of bitches
Finally arrive at the restaurant rite as I finish cumming
The women start whining asking why we gotta go to an eye-talian Place
Saying their models so they cant eat carbs & shit
How unfortunate, tell the bitches to sit at the bar eating martini olives
While I sit in a big booth by myself eating pasta
