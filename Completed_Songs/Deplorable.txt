[INTRO]
[sound of car door slamming, engine idling, gritty atmosphere]
[Spoken Word, deep voice]
Real Hood shit, bruh…

[VERSE 1]
[heavy 808s, ominous piano loop, deliberate flow]
Got so much guap that Victoria's Secret fashion shows for me
Is just window shopping, and you already know my whip game proper
Whippin' a '59 Impala, blaring Frank Sinatra
Hydraulics make the bitch sit crooked
Crew in the backseat watching the loot we took
During the bank robbery in broad daylight, yet again successful
As I pull into the garage on 7th Avenue

[VERSE 1 - PART 2]
[beat intensifies, faster delivery]
I treat Chicago like my own personal version of Grand Theft Auto
All the way down to killin' and robbin' sluts after I finish nutting
And to think my mama never thought I’d amount to nothin'
Tell the bitch to pour me a beverage and make it snappy
Feed them hoes Plan B every morning, I call it breakfast in bed
'Cause tending to a flock of hoes means makin' sure none of 'em gettin' knocked up

[PRE-CHORUS]
[stripped back beat, menacing whispers]
And since they on their knees all day slobbing knobs
Ya gotta make sure they get their nutrients
So I send my bitches out with a balanced breakfast
Not to mention the nutritious lunch I packed for them
Like chips and baloney sandwiches

[BRIDGE]
[dark synth pads, psychological tension]
Scary Terry break 'em down causing psychological damage
Curb their behavior into unequivocal subservience
Whereby you inflict punishment for anything less than total obedience
While awarding them for listening with strong barbiturates
Before you know it they're nothin' more than human servants
Running errands and recruiting additional sluts
It’s all a self-fulfilling prophecy

[CHORUS]
[heavy distortion, stutter effect on vocals, aggressive]
Scary, sca-scary Terry, he so deplorable
He a ma-monster, roaring at you from an anthracite Fer-Ferrari
Smo-smoking marijuana on 200 milli of Adderall

[VERSE 2]
[classic boom-bap drum pattern, confident swagger]
First time she talk back she get the backhand like my man Sean Connery
(Shometimesh they need a lil' shallappin') [imitating Sean Connery accent]
Second time it happen I say fuck it and pistol whip 'em
Now she can't work due to a black eye
Whatever, sell her off to the black guys in the trap
Hopefully this overreaction will cause other hoes to take notice
And fall in line accordingly

[VERSE 2 - PART 2]
[complex flow, luxury rap style]
The abundance of paper coming in is inordinate
Sneaking heroin in past the Port Authority
Thots, yachts, and watches make up my top 3 priorities
Call me OutKast 'cause I be so fresh and so clean
Where did your soul go bro? I don’t know I haven’t seen it
Might’ve traded it in for one or two blue Beamers
Or possibly the Maybach or anthracite Bentley
Might be a bit outta control recently

[BREAKDOWN]
[cinematic strings, slow narrative flow]
The former be for formal occasions
Decked out in black and red to give it the old school Corleone aesthetic
Where the only music allowed is the Rat Pack or similar crooners
The latter be for cruising late at night, matte black no lights
Steady flow of Shyne or that old school late 90s murder music

[OUTRO]
[aggressive delivery, building to abrupt stop]
I tried to teach 'em the art of the streets but they not handle my tutelage
Buncha losers full of cowardice, it’s a miracle you made it as far as you did
I refuse to excuse such a retarded mindset
So when I see 'em, I make his face beat up my hands
I guarantee the F.P. Journe Élégante with the sky blue dial
Sittin' so fly on my wrist is the closest you get to anything six-figure expensive
Better just accept it, bitch
[sound of gunshot]
[End]
