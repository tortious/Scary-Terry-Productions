[Intro, Banjo Picking and Hand Claps]
(Giddy up, girl. You still gotta make me some dinner) 

[Verse 1]
I’s Growing up, my meemaw done raised me
Whip me into shape, if she saw me lazy
Hoo lawd, boy howdy I miss her like crazy 
Thanks to that lady, who made me 
A pretty decent fella who enjoys blazing 

[Chorus]
I said ahem, excuse me, miss 
I’m a boozy Susie begging for a kiss
Life can be tough, boy it sure is a doozy 
Why hammer a nail when you could be screwing
Excuse me, My education is the hard knocks schooling
Pour another pitcher & call me lil Richard 
As I place my tooty in your fruity

[Verse 2]
Sun creeps in, adderall awakens me 
Whenever my previous night’s decisions end up forsaken me
Could be worse, waking up in public all nakedly 
Or balls frozen to ice down at the skating rink


[Chorus]
I said ahem, excuse me, miss 
I’m a boozy Susie begging for a kiss
Life can be tough, boy it sure is a doozy 
Why hammer a nail when you could be screwing
Excuse me, My education is the hard knocks schooling
Pour another pitcher & call me lil Richard 
As I place my tooty in your fruity

[Bridge, Fiddle Breakdown]
(Roota toot toot let’s find us a floozy)
(Skeetily deet deet make her do a hawk-tooey)

[Final Chorus]
I said ahem, excuse me, miss 
I’m a boozy Susie begging for a kiss
Life can be tough, boy it sure is a doozy 
Why hammer a nail when you could be screwing
Excuse me, My education is the hard knocks schooling
Pour another pitcher & call me lil Richard 
As I place my tooty in your fruity

[Outro, Crowd Chanting & Banjo Fade]
