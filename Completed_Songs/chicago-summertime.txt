[verse 1]
Michigan avenue in late July cuz no matter where I’m living I still gotta make a trip home to Chicago in the summertime
Excellent blend of heat but not too much humidity
Hop on in my hot rod for a cruise on the Kennedy
Heading down to the city, the skyline magnificent first exit we make is Addison where I find a spot out the benz and so commences yet another boozy brunch with all our friends, yo the mimosas are stupendous I swear it can’t get better than this a few hugs and kisses and me & the girl are back on the road adventurizing

Thank you very much…

[chorus]
[hook delivery: airy & taunting with a smirk]
Here ya go babe, got ur coat, into the cab we go
Lately I dunno why but I’ve been getting sentimental
Waiting to reminiscence again seems like a means to an end cuz all I’m doing is looking forward to looking back
I suppose I’ll tell my doc on Monday as I’m sure he’ll have a pill to help with that

[verse 2]
Let me tell ya folks, for all its fault Chicago holds something special to me
A cherished memory of time not that long ago
that I’m not quite ready to let go
When Nickelodeon was the sole channel you & all your homies know
Bit of an elder millennial, it was 7th grade when I got my first cell phone
Getting high scores in snake & Hell no don’t call my cell yet I only get free nights & weekends
Absolutely freakin that ur parents’ll go nuts due to charges from hittin the internet button
Similar to how they’d give you the boot if you were on and they needed to phone someone
Half our life we had the tech & half our life we didn’t, so at that point we’d just go outside & play as normal kids
Destroying our ankles stunting on razor skooters
Aside from the 2 Colorado kids there wasn’t school shootings cuz cyber bullying wasn’t yet a thing, rather two kids would punch each other in the face until one wins, then in a matter of no time everyone gets over it, just part of grown up and shit

[chorus]
[hook delivery: airy & taunting with a smirk]
Here ya go babe, got ur coat, into the cab we go
Lately I dunno why but I’ve been getting sentimental
Waiting to reminiscence again seems like a means to an end cuz all I’m doing is looking forward to looking back
I suppose I’ll tell my doc on Monday as I’m sure he’ll have a pill to help with that

[whispered sarcastically, fading into reverb]
