[Intro, Banjo strum, Upbeat acoustic guitar]

[Verse 1]  
She’s independent, wasn’t looking for love
She don’t drink much and don’t do no drugs
Works real hard and keeps things neat
Last thing she expected was to be swept off her feet

[Verse 2]  
Hoo boy, Troy, I’m talking bout youuu
You make her happy and your hairs pretty cool
Gotta couple of pups, a snake named Fred 
Now raise your cups and listen to what I said

[Chorus]  
Pop the bubbly, and don’t forget to thank god
For these 2 are lovely, a couple peas in a pod
Tip of the cap, giving Cupid a nod
I may be a sap, but they’re 2 peas in a pod

[Verse 3]  
Hanging with them, you know it’s a good time
He’s funny as hell and she’s sweet as pie
So damn glad they’re both in my life
Congrats to ash’s husband, and Troy’s new wife 

[Chorus]  
Pop the bubbly, and don’t forget to thank god
For these 2 are lovely, a couple peas in a pod
Tip of the cap, giving Cupid a nod
I may be a sap, but they’re 2 peas in a pod

[Bridge, Banjo solo and light claps]  
Big surprise, Terry wrote this song
Thanks for being in my life and never doing me wrong

[Final Chorus, Full band, joyful energy]  
Pop the bubbly, and don’t forget to thank god
For these 2 are lovely, a couple peas in a pod
Tip of the cap, giving Cupid a nod
I may be a sap, but they’re 2 peas in a pod

Yeah yeah thank you god…
For these two peas in a pod…

[Outro, Banjo fade, happy acoustic riff]
