[INTRO]
[Slow Vinyl Crackle FX]
[Distorted Saxophone Riff]
[Tape Flutter]
(Bitch, I said touch it)
Scary Terry Productions...

[VERSE 1]
[Smooth Croon-Rap]
Love me the Summertime in Chicago, it is the epitome of greatness
My Gulfstream just touched down on a ramp in Midway
Since my answer to O'Hare be "Oh hell no, anywhere but there"
In the back of the Maybach, I light up some marijuana [LIGHTER FLICK FX]
Ugh, that Khalifa Kush, they call it KK (cough)
I am too high to remember but it seems to do the job sufficiently
Since I am high as shit trying to simultaneously parlay a bet
And set up a soirée for this evening [ICE CUBES CLINKING FX]
Didn't even notice the car is at my building
Pop another pill then to the driver throw deuces like "later"
As I stumble my way into the elevator [ELEVATOR DING FX]

[CHORUS]
[Deep Sub Bass Boost]
[Layered Vocals]
It is wise to remember, I got options
Put my member between your thighs and swallow it
Scary Terry stay Mister Big Pimpin'
Or whatever you wanna call it
Take two of these and call me in the morning
Don't try to keep up with me
Scary Terry always on the move and never stop balling [CASH REGISTER FX]

[VERSE 2]
[Aggressive Jazz Piano]
[Muffled Party Ambience]
When you get here, the doorman will send you up, you know the drill
It is understandable when they stand and stare
At the expensive and eclectic chandelier in the foyer
To those new or just getting here, the booze and craft beer is in the living room
Bubbly and drugs be in the study
Should be enough to even make Scarface start blushing [MANIC LAUGH FX]
And through the corridor, down at the end of the hallway
You will find a world-class sommelier
Cause y'all know I never play when it comes to Bordeaux and Cabernet [POURING WINE FX]
I just keep nodding along at whatever that babbling bitch is saying
As my gaze glances toward her tits flopping around
Cause she is talking so animated
Don't worry about noise, this the penthouse, we own all of it
Into my mouth go all of the Adderall
Cause that is all there is between Scary Terry's sanity
And this lovely shindig becoming a violent calamity [GLASS BREAK FX]

[CHORUS]
[Deep Sub Bass Boost]
[Layered Vocals]
It is wise to remember, I got options
Put my member between your thighs and swallow it
Scary Terry stay Mister Big Pimpin'
Or whatever you wanna call it
Take two of these and call me in the morning
Don't try to keep up with me
Scary Terry always on the move and never stop balling

[VERSE 3]
[Menacing Flow]
[Ambient Horn Stabs]
Sipping tea on those teeny little saucers
Like the Kermit meme conveying that it is none of my business
While pondering the difficulty of being so retarded
Honestly, looks exhausting
If you wanna discuss something about my sociopathic ass
Your disgusting slut of a wife licked my ass
That's right, your bitch a salad tosser
Scary Terry committed to only one lady
And her name be Genocide (Jenny-cide)
You know, like the incredibly violent Apartheid
I am pretty sick aren't I? Thankfully I am smart
Cause I just stay calm and ball harder
Like Weezy F Baby aka Dwayne Carter
Who authored Tha Carter III
That which helped harden Scary Terry as a youngin a lot
It was him and Gucci that taught me to be steady mobbing [GHOSTLY ECHO OUT]

[OUTRO]
[Distorted Saxophone Solo]
[Fade Out with Tape Flutter]
(Steady mobbing...)
(Scary Terry...)

💡 PRODUCTION NOTES:
This configuration is optimized for a "Leisurely Thug" vibe (approx 84 BPM feel).
* **Corrections:** Expanded all "u" to "you," "wit" to "with." Corrected "suaré" to "soirée" and "Jenny side" to "Genocide" (with phonetic helper) to ensure the rhyme with "Apartheid" lands correctly.
* **Sound Design:** Integrated specific luxury FX like `[POURING WINE FX]` and `[ELEVATOR DING FX]` to match the narrative.
* **Instrumentation:** The Style Box prioritizes "distorted saxophone" and "aggressive jazz piano" as requested in your header.

🎯 ADVANCED TECHNIQUES USED:
* **Letter Case Optimization:** THUG RAP/JAZZ RAP in caps, descriptors in Title Case, instruments in lower case.
* **Metatags:** `[Smooth Croon-Rap]` vs `[Aggressive Jazz Piano]` creates the requested contrast between smooth vocals and manic instrumentation.
* **Contextual FX:** `[LIGHTER FLICK FX]` and `[ICE CUBES CLINKING FX]` placed specifically where the lyrics mention drugs and drinks.
