[Intro, Easy Strum & Whistle]
(See, in order to educate we must all defecate equally on all plates before we dare promulgate or think we've mastered da bait.)

[Verse 1]
Summertime, me and the boys go party
I packer like I’m Green Bay or my name is lombardi 
Better late than pregnant if you’re gonna be tardy
Hot damn I am the fire, you’re just the retardant 

[Chorus, Singalong Vibe]
Ahem, if I may, excuse me miss
This is damn hard to say, but I gotta do this
You got my jimmies rustled
You got my Johnnie’s jostled
And the way my Frankie’s fondled, I didn’t think possible! 

[Verse 2]
Straights shots of whiskey got me going all gonzo 
I train her all day like my first name Alonzo
that’s right just gotta moisten the pooty 
And please do me skoozy
The way she blowfish oughta call her hootie

[Chorus, Full Band In]
Ahem, if I may, excuse me miss
This is damn hard to say, but I gotta do this
You got my jimmies rustled
You got my Johnnie’s jostled
And the way my Frankie’s fondled, I didn’t think possible! 

[Bridge, Laid Back Harmony]
In these assless chaps, I run for miles
Cuz I'm an American, from the U S of A
Costco? Not there again, got banned for what I say
But I think that it’s important to be clear 
As long as she reaches around it don’t make it queer. 


[Chorus, Final Round with Handclaps]
Ahem, if I may, excuse me miss
This is damn hard to say, but I gotta do this
You got my jimmies rustled
You got my Johnnie’s jostled
And the way my Frankie’s fondled, I didn’t think possible! 

[Outro, Harmonica Fade]
(Call me mr robot like rami malek, have some kielbasa and I’m sorry it’s phallic, boogie boo toodaloo, im fantastic…my behind elastic…and spastic…)
