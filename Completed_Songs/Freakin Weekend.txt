[Intro, Banjo Riff]
(Skrrt-skrrt, crack a cold one, let’s go!)  

[Verse 1]    
The name’s Bud Spite, that’s just what they call me 
The way hootie blows fish, I drink down all these 
Some say I’m dumb, I’d say I’m just ballsy
She make me feel so good, sure do hope she does call me
Cuz She make it shake so good,  like she got cerebral palsy  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Dust on my hat, sun droppin' low  
Tailgate’s down, let the moonlight glow  

They think they’re cool, making fun of meee
Wait til they see this hog in my dungareeeees

[Chorus]  
It’s the freakin weekend, I’m about to have me some fun
But don’t pee on they belly, like the homie R Kelly
Yeah, he flew too close to the sun
But not this guy, I keep it fly 
And never do a peeps on the young 

[Verse 2]  
I count my my blessings, I always knock on wood
Im a be cool, see, cuz I moisten the pooty
And I'm always smoking that good  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Get off yours asses, and raise ya glasses, for the ol’ U S of A
So long as she be passing, I be tapping, it only makes me a little gay   

[Chorus]  
It’s the freakin weekend, I’m about to have me some fun
But don’t pee on they belly, like the homie R Kelly
Yeah, he flew too close to the sun
But not this guy, I keep it fly 
And never do a peeps on the young

[Bridge, Instrumental Breakdown]  
[Guitar Solo, Banjo Twang]  
(Ahh yeah, freakin n squeaking with the  throat goat  echo)  

[Chorus]  
It’s the freakin weekend, I’m about to have me some fun
But don’t pee on they belly, like the homie R Kelly
Yeah, he flew too close to the sun
But not this guy, I keep it fly 
And never do a peeps on the young

[Outro, Fading Banjo and Crowd Cheers]  
(I’m bud Spite and this my song, as Rodney king said, let’s all get along)
