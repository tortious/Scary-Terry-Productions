[Intro, Slide Guitar, Foot-Stompin’ Beat]
(Ahh yeah, that’s mighty white of you)

[Verse 1]
I used to walk outside and feel fantastic
I like my beaches wide, bootyholes elastic
Now it’s varying shades of brown in this town
Making my trigger finger feel spastic
Someone’s getting their ass kicked…

[Pre-Chorus]
Black and yellow and brown and gay 
Keep that foreign shit to yourself, okay? 

[Chorus]
No trouble on our street, no sir, not here
We light up every corner, and clear it of queers
From the cul-de-sac to the house they smoke crack
My 12 gauge shottie too hottie make em all take a nap
Were the street sweepers, the neighborhood watch
You know she’s a keeper when she fondles your crotch 

[Verse 2]
We got block chats, flashlights in hand
Jane’s got the cameras, Mike’s got the plan
Late night patrols, thermoses of joe
Rockin’ neon vests like a hometown show

Like an Indian, send us your bobs and Vajeen
Keep that pooty clean & ya dreams will come true
And it’s my duty to glean whether you’re a Jew 

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re friendly folks but we are furious with the gays 
Hooo boy, relax brother, did you get your period today? 

[Chorus]
No trouble on our street, no sir, not here
We light up every corner, and clear it of queers
From the cul-de-sac to the house they smoke crack
My 12 gauge shottie too hottie make em all take a nap
Were the street sweepers, the neighborhood watch
You know she’s a keeper when she fondles your crotch


[Bridge, Harmonic Surprise, Fiddle Layer]
(Oh baby I kick butt and chew bubble gum)
(If they come back round here, they going to struggle some. )

[Break, Clap Beat]
(Microwave pizza and cheap liquor’)
(Clean your clock spic and span ya nicker)

[Chorus, Power Repeat]
No trouble on our street, no sir, not here
We light up every corner, and clear it of queers
From the cul-de-sac to the house they smoke crack
My 12 gauge shottie too hottie make em all take a nap
Were the street sweepers, the neighborhood watch
You know she’s a keeper when she fondles your crotch


[Outro, Fading Slide Guitar]
Hooo lawd almighty…
praise be to whitey...
