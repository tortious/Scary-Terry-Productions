[Intro, Gentle acoustic picking, Soft piano]

[Verse 1] 

If you ask me, Ashley, I’d say grandma’d be proud
You landed a stand-up man to share these vows
It’s about time you found someone deserving of your heart
Just kinda funny to think he’d been there from the start 

[Verse 2] 
Hooo boy, Troy, I’m talking bout you
You make her real happy & your hairs really cool
Big surprise, this song was written by Terry 
I’m just so happy for y’all & glad you’re getting married!

[Chorus]  
Friends at first, it wasn’t  love at first site
That darn timing never right 
He done went left 
She done went right 
But they found each other, thank god 
Cuz everybody know they’re two peas in a pod

[Verse 3]  
She loves to bake apple pie, boy  he sure is lucky
Shoutout Fred the snake & your two adorable puppies 
I’m just so damn glad & can tell you love her
And I’m pretty jazzed about gaining a new brother


[Chorus]  
Friends at first, it wasn’t  love at first site
That darn timing never right 
He done went left 
She done went right 
But they found each other, thank god 
Cuz everybody know they’re two peas in a pod

[Bridge, Soft piano interlude]  
Kinda different, yeah, opposites attract   
True love in their hearts, I know you feel that
Now I promise, not tryna be a meanie
Just strange to think she’s now Mrs Peach-a-neeny 

[Final Chorus, Soft build]  
Friends at first, it wasn’t  love at first site
That darn timing never right 
He done went left 
She done went right 
But they found each other, thank god 
Cuz everybody know they’re two peas in a pod

Yeah, gotta give Cupid a nod
And thank god
For these two peas in a pod


[Outro, Gentle guitar fade]
