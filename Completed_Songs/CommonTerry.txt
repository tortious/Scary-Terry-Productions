[Intro, Club Siren & Bass Drop]
(Ayy, leggoo, yo not my eggo, my ego check. Feral stank, call me gas tank —pooty patrol in full effect!)
(Y’all ready to moisten it up?)

[Verse 1, Male Voice]  
Call me common Terry, cuz I got comments to make
And we keep that pooty moistened, like the bottom of a lake
Deep on the street, I keep it bloody while krippin 
Damn buddy, you trippin and must not have an interest in living
Cuz I stay steady pimpin’
Faces get smacked, hashtag no mittens  

[Verse 2, Female Voice]
Hail from Chiraq, born in a war zone 
Haha just kidding, inapplicable to my homes
Cuz my phat ass is upper class 
Now please pass the mascarpone 

[Chorus, Club Chant]
Hoo lawd she fine and got a big ol’ booty
Hope it don’t smell like a Taco Bell dookie
It drip low, but I’m so high that it’s spooky 
Aww snap, it’s drying up— time to moisten the pooty!  

[Verse 3, Male Voice]
Got some truths for the youths, yall best not get huffy
Please please just trust me, before you suffer unjustly 
Continue? Must we? 
I see some shady sores in her lady pores
Hot damn, looked crusty and smelt musty

[Verse 4, Female Voice]
We all been there, putting from the rough
Don’t enrage just gauge when the pooty is a bust 
Because if her flappers ain’t dapper 
You gotta say enough 

[Chorus, Club Chant]
Hoo lawd she fine and got a big ol’ booty
Hope it don’t smell like a Taco Bell dookie
It drip low, but I’m so high that it’s spooky 
Aww snap, it’s drying up— time to moisten the pooty!

[Bridge, Slow Grind Breakdown]
(Odors rise up, stank don’t lie
If your pooty ain’t moist, then hunny bye bye )
(Back it up, like you juvenile…shalacking like im senile)  

[Chorus, Final Drop]
Hoo lawd she fine and got a big ol’ booty
Hope it don’t smell like a Taco Bell dookie
It drip low, but I’m so high that it’s spooky 
Aww snap, it’s drying up— time to moisten the pooty!

[Outro, Club Crowd Fade]
(Ayy! All Fecal Matters Productions, shout out “feed us, fetus” your #2 meal good as hell—moist gang forever)
