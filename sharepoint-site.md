Here’s a set of style and organization concepts for your Scary Terry Productions SharePoint site that fit your brand vibe while keeping it functional and easy to navigate. I’ll break them into visual style, site structure, and content organization so you can implement in layers.

⸻

1. Visual Style & Branding

Goal: Make it scream Scary Terry Productions—high-impact visuals, consistent theme, and subtle “Easter eggs” for personality.
	•	Theme & Color Palette
	•	Dark mode base with neon highlight accents (deep charcoal background, neon pink, cyan, and lime green call-to-actions).
	•	Use a muted pastel variant (watermelon, creamsicle, etc.) for lighter “creative” areas like Music Lab pages.
	•	Apply custom theme JSON so document libraries and lists carry brand colors.
	•	Logo & Header
	•	Place your Scary Terry Productions ghostface-horn logo as the top-left fixed element.
	•	Animated or rotating masthead images featuring your album art, behind-the-scenes photos, and branded street photography.
	•	Typography
	•	Use bold sans-serif for headings (e.g., Montserrat or Oswald via SPFx customizer).
	•	Use clean serif or mono for lyrics/project notes to give them a “published” feel.
	•	Background Imagery
	•	Cinematic Chicago skyline night shots with glowing overlays.
	•	Photo overlays with glitch/distortion effects for pages related to “Street Projects” or “Gangsta Cowboy” themes.

2. Site Structure

Goal: Clear navigation that separates “creative” from “ops” but keeps it all in one tenant.

Top Navigation
	•	🏠 Home – landing hub with announcements, featured project, and quick links.
	•	🎵 Music Lab – lyrics, beats, AI Music Lab exports, and audio file libraries.
	•	🎨 Visuals – album art, merch mockups, branding assets, photoshoots.
	•	📂 Project Archives – past productions, retired projects, historical artwork.
	•	🛠 Ops & Business – contracts, invoices, collabs, release schedules.
	•	📅 Calendar – embedded Outlook/Teams events tied to release & promo.
	•	🔍 Search Portal – branded search page filtering to your production libraries.

Sub-Hubs
	•	Each main area can be its own modern site page with:
	•	Hero Web Part for top visuals
	•	Quick Links Web Part to child pages/lists
	•	Document Library Web Part filtered to relevant content
	•	List Web Part for tracking (e.g., song progress, merch orders)

3. Content Organization

Goal: Keep it tight so you can find anything fast, while making the site look like a portfolio.
	•	Document Libraries
	•	Lyrics & Scripts (folders by project/album)
	•	Instrumentals & Stems (tag by BPM, key, mood, AI/real source)
	•	Artwork (tag by project, artist, type: cover art, promo, merch)
	•	Legal/Business (contracts, collab agreements, NDAs)
	•	Lists
	•	Production Tracker – song name, status (writing, recording, mixing, mastered), % complete, notes.
	•	Release Planner – release date, platforms, promo tasks.
	•	Collaboration Log – name, role, contact, project, deliverables.
	•	Merch Tracker – item, design mockup link, vendor, cost, stock.
	•	Metadata
	•	Managed metadata columns for Project Name, Type (Audio, Visual, Doc), Status, and Release Phase.
	•	Makes filtering in document libraries clean and consistent.

4. Bonus Flair & Functionality
	•	Embedded Player – Use the File Viewer or Embed Web Part for playable MP3/WAV demos directly on project pages.
	•	Custom JSON List Formatting – Color-coded rows for song status (green=ready, yellow=in progress, red=urgent).
	•	Countdown Widget – For next release date.
	•	Pinned Hero Tiles – Link to your latest single’s Spotify page or Bandcamp.
	•	Brand Easter Eggs – Hide “Scary Terry” quotes or visual jokes in web part descriptions.
