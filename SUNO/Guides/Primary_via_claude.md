## 1. Introduction & Overview

Suno responds best to clear, structured prompts that separate lyrics from musical instructions. The platform uses two main input areas:

- **Custom Lyrics Box**: Your formatted lyrics with structural tags
- **Style/Genre Descriptor Box**: Musical style, instruments, mood, and production details

## 2. Lyrics Formatting Fundamentals

### Basic Structure Tags

Use square brackets `[ ]` for all structural elements:

```
[Intro]
[Verse 1]
Your lyrics here
More lyrics

[Pre-Chorus]
Building up the energy

[Chorus]
The main hook goes here
Catchy and memorable

[Verse 2]
Second verse content

[Bridge]
Something different

[Outro]
```

### Essential Formatting Rules

1. **Line Breaks**: Single line break between lyric lines, double line break between sections
1. **No Quotation Marks**: Avoid quotes around lyrics
1. **Punctuation**: Use sparingly - periods and commas can create natural pauses
1. **Parentheses**: Use for backing vocals or ad-libs: `(oh yeah)` or `(repeat)`

### Emergency Fixes Checklist

1. **Vocals unclear?** → Add “clear prominent vocals, vocal-forward mix”
1. **Too fast?** → Add “steady pacing, measured delivery, [specific BPM]”
1. **Wrong style?** → Simplify genre description, remove contradictions
1. **Bad structure?** → Ensure all tags use square brackets, proper spacing
1. **Weak energy?** → Add dynamic descriptors: “building energy, powerful chorus”

Remember: Suno responds best to clear, consistent formatting and specific musical language. When in doubt, be more specific rather than vague, and always separate structural elements from actual lyrics using the square bracket notation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
