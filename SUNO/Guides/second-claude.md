I remember when I didn't have a dollar to my name
Now I'm stacking up these blessings, never playing any games
Mama told me "Boy, you better work for what you want"
So I'm grinding every day, staying focused on the hunt
Every setback was a setup for a major comeback
Never looking in the rearview, I ain't playing with the flashback
```
#### **[CHORUS]** / **[HOOK]**

We rise, we rise, and the whole world knows
```
#### **[PRE-CHORUS]**
- Builds tension before chorus
- Usually 2-4 bars

- 4-8 bars
```
[BRIDGE]

"Baby, you're stronger than you know"
And those words help me through when I'm feeling low
```
#### **[OUTRO]**

Now I'm counting up these blessings, every loss was a lesson, never fail
Got the Rollie on my wrist, dripping water like a well
And my circle getting smaller, only keeping ones who real, I can tell
Money calling, I been running to it all year
Posted with the day ones, same ones from last year
No new friends in my circle, that's a fact here
We don't do the fake love, we don't do the cap here
[HOOK]
[layered vocals, Auto-Tune, anthem-like]
We gon' make it out (out, out)

Started from the bottom, now we up, we don't route (route, route)
Count these blessings, run it up, that's what we about (yeah)
[VERSE 2]
[bass drop, aggressive 808 slide]
Momma said I'm blessed, I got that gift, I got that vision

Got me focused on the prize, tunnel vision, no collision

Spitting consciousness while other rappers talking nonsense, honestly
The world needs healing, not another flex about the materialism
I'm speaking from the soul, trying to break through the cynicism
Educated my mind, liberated my thoughts
Now I'm sharing this wisdom, teaching what can't be bought
From the concrete jungle where the struggle is real
But I rose above the pain, now I'm helping others heal
[CHORUS]
[melodic sample, full drums]
We keep rising up, elevating minds
Breaking down the chains of the times
Spreading knowledge through these rhymes
One verse at a time, one word at a time
[VERSE 2]
[bass-heavy, horn sample hits]
They want us in the system, but I'm systematic in my resistance
Plotting my ascension while maintaining my existence
Reading Malcolm, Martin, Huey, understanding the assignment

This ain't just rap, this is revolutionary thought
Taking all the lessons that my ancestors taught
Translating pain into purpose, struggle into strength
Going to whatever lengths to speak my truth at length

Moving different now, yeah, we living out the vision
Never took a loss, every play is a winning position
Opps be talking crazy on the net, that's fiction

I'm about my business, stack my money with precision
Never switching sides, loyalty's my only mission
[adlibs: bow, boom, ayy]
[HOOK]

Never fold, never stray (never)

[808 slide emphasis, dark atmosphere]
Started from nothing, now we really getting paid
Made it out the struggle, every scar is displayed
Keep my circle tight, all my brothers in the shade

[INTRO]
[pedal steel guitar bend, acoustic guitar strum]
[VERSE 1]
[steady two-step rhythm, upright bass, brushed snare]
Well, I woke up this morning with the sunrise in my eyes
Coffee on the stove and a thousand memories inside
This old farmhouse holds stories in every weathered board
Daddy's boots still by the door, Mama's Bible on the Lord
I've been working these same fields since I was just a boy
Learning that hard work brings more than simple joy
It builds character and calluses upon your hands
Teaching you the value of this hard-earned land
[CHORUS]
[pedal steel prominent, honky-tonk piano fills]
This is country living, simple and true
Honest work from dawn til the day is through
We don't need much, just family and faith
That's the country way, that's how we were raised
[VERSE 2]
[fiddle enters, classic country shuffle]
Saturday nights we gather at the local dance hall
Fiddle and guitar making music for us all
Pretty girls in sundresses, boots upon their feet
This is where the heart of America still beats
We say grace before our supper, hold the door for those behind
Still believe a handshake is a promise of your mind
May be old-fashioned but that's fine by me
This is how we live, this is how we'll always be
[BRIDGE]
[stripped to acoustic and pedal steel]
The world keeps changing, moving way too fast
But some things are worth keeping from the past
[FINAL CHORUS]

This is country living, the way it ought to be
Roots run deep in family and community
We'll keep these traditions, pass them to our kids
That's the legacy we live, that's what country is

[INTRO]
[gritty electric guitar, raw production]
(Harmonica wail)
[VERSE 1]
[driving beat, baritone vocals, unpolished]
I never fit in with the Nashville crowd
Too rough around edges, played my music too loud
They wanted polished perfection, radio-ready sound
But I was busy chasing truth instead of chasing fame around
Mama warned me about the road I chose to take
Said "Son, that path is hard, how much can your heart take?"
But I was born with highway running through my veins
Can't settle down in one place, can't be contained by chains
[CHORUS]
[full band, defiant]
I'm an outlaw, playing by my own rules
Never went to college, never suffered fools
Got my guitar and my stories to tell
Living on the edge between heaven and hell
[VERSE 2]
[whiskey-soaked vocal delivery]
Seen every honky-tonk from Texas up to Tennessee
Played for drunks and dreamers who saw themselves in me
We don't need the fancy venues or the corporate stage
Just truth in every lyric and fire burning in our rage
Against the machine trying to package and sell
The real raw emotion that we know so well
So I'll keep playing dives where the beer is cheap
Where the music's honest and the feelings run deep
[BRIDGE]
[acoustic guitar, intimate]
Willie said it best, "Mammas don't let your babies
Grow up to be cowboys" but here I am
Maybe I'm a fool, maybe I'm a dreamer
But at least I'm free, at least I am
[FINAL CHORUS]
[rowdy, live-band energy]
I'm an outlaw, never playing their game
Rather die unknown than sell out for fame
Got my guitar, my whiskey, my pride
Living this outlaw life until I die
[OUTRO]
[harmonica and guitar]
Yeah, until I die
[abrupt stop]

```
[INTRO]
[fingerpicked acoustic guitar, ambient drone]
[VERSE 1]
[minimal - acoustic guitar, soft percussion, intimate vocals]
Drove through the mountains in October's dying light
Leaves were falling fast like years that disappeared from sight
Turned on the radio but found no signal there
Just static and the silence of the cold autumn air
I've been searching for meaning in the spaces in between
The life I thought I'd live and the places I have been
There's poetry in failure, there's beauty in the fall
Sometimes you learn the most when you lose it all
[CHORUS]
[instruments swell - pedal steel, bass, gentle drums]
We're all just wanderers on borrowed time
Finding grace notes in this grand design
The road unfolds like stories yet untold
In this Americana, in this heart of gold
[VERSE 2]
[banjo enters softly, layered with acoustic]
Small town diners with their neon signs half-lit
Remind me of the dreams we had before we let them slip
Coffee's cold but the waitress smile is warm
She's seen it all before, every traveler, every storm
I order pie and coffee, watch the world outside
Eighteen-wheelers rolling down the interstate divide
Between the life we're given and the life we hope to find
Somewhere in America, somewhere in our minds
[BRIDGE]
[stripped down to just vocal and guitar]
And if you listen closely to the wind through the pines
You can hear the voices of these Appalachian times
Singing songs of struggle, singing songs of hope
Teaching us that somehow we will cope
[FINAL CHORUS]
[full band, building emotion]
We're all just wanderers collecting our own truth
Finding beauty in the wreckage of our youth
The road unfolds like poetry and pain
In this Americana, in the sun and rain
[OUTRO]
[instruments fade one by one back to solo acoustic]
In the sun and rain
[final strum, long sustain]
```

Sailing through the sunset on the California coast
Crystal clear water and the ones we love the most
Life's a smooth operator when you're living in the zone

We've got nothing but time and the ocean breeze
This is paradise, this is living free

Cities fade behind us as we cruise into the night
Stars reflecting on the water, everything's alright
Got my baby next to me, got the radio up loud

This is that West Coast energy, sophisticated and cool
Breaking all the barriers, we don't play by the rules
Just living for the moment in this perfect melody
Yacht rock forever, that's our legacy
[SAX SOLO]

Close your eyes and feel the breeze
Let the rhythm set you free
This is where we're meant to be
Floating on this melody

Morning coffee on the porch, watching the world wake up
Simple moments like these filling my cup
You're beside me in your robe, hair down, makeup-free
This is all I ever needed, this is everything to me
We don't need the fancy restaurants or champagne wishes
Just your hand in mine and morning breakfast dishes
The way you laugh at my bad jokes and kiss my cheek
These little things make every single day complete
[CHORUS]

This is the good life, simple and true
Every morning I wake up grateful for you
No need for more, we've got it all right here
This is the good life, this is why we're here
[VERSE 2]
[electric piano joins, fuller arrangement]
Afternoon drives with no destination in mind
Windows down and your hand in mine
Radio playing those songs we used to know
Taking the long way home, driving slow
Friends come over for dinner, conversation flows like wine
Laughing about old times until way past nine
These are the memories that money can't buy
These are the reasons why I'm gratified
[BRIDGE]
[stripped to piano and vocal]
Sometimes the greatest treasures
Are the simplest pleasures
Found in everyday measures
These moments last forever
[FINAL CHORUS]
[full band, strings swell, background vocal harmonies]
This is the good life, simple and true (so true)
Every morning I wake up grateful for you (grateful for you)

Baby, won't you stay with me a while?

Two souls intertwined in perfect harmony
This ain't just physical, girl, this is spiritual
Our love is undeniable, unmistakable, it's beautiful

## Pro Tips and Best Practices
### 1. **Iterate on Generations**
Don't expect perfection on first try. Generate multiple versions:
- Try 3-5 generations with same lyrics but vary:
- Weirdness slider
- Style descriptors
- Keep best, remix rest
### 2. **Use Reference Tracks**
When describing style, reference specific artists:
```
Style: trap in the style of Metro Boomin, dark like Travis Scott's production
```
### 3. **Layer Your Tags**
Combine multiple bracket types:
```
[VERSE 2]
[aggressive trap beat with bell sounds]
[confident, fast delivery]
Your lyrics here
[ad-libs: yeah, uh, skrrt]
```
### 4. **Mind Your Character Budget**
- Count characters before pasting
- Use shorter section tags when possible
- Combine similar verses if running low
### 5. **Leverage "Use Last Prompt"**
The interface offers "Use last prompt" - great for:
- Creating variations
- Extending songs
- Maintaining consistency
### 6. **Test Slider Combinations**
Keep a note of successful slider settings for different genres:
```
Trap: 35% weirdness, 65% style influence
Experimental Jazz: 75% weirdness, 50% style influence
Traditional Country: 25% weirdness, 75% style influence
```
### 7. **Strategic Exclusions**
Always exclude what you DON'T want:
- For rap: exclude "singing" if you want pure rap
- For acoustic: exclude "electronic, synthetic"
- For specific vibes: exclude opposite emotions
### 8. **Chorus Repetition**
You can copy/paste chorus sections, or use:
```
[CHORUS]
(Lyrics here)
[VERSE 2]
(Verse lyrics)
[CHORUS]
(Repeat)
```
Or just write it once and the AI often repeats it naturally.
### 9. **Ad-Lib Placement**
Strategic ad-libs enhance rap tracks:
```
[VERSE 1]
Main lyrics here (yeah)
More lyrics (uh-huh)
Punch line (ayy)
[ad-libs: yeah, uh, let's go]
```
### 10. **Build Dynamics**
Use brackets to create sonic journeys:
```
[INTRO - sparse, minimal]
[VERSE 1 - building]
[CHORUS - full energy]
[VERSE 2 - pull back slightly]
[BRIDGE - stripped down]
[FINAL CHORUS - maximum energy]
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
### 1. **Over-Describing in Style Box**
❌ **Bad:**
```
dark trap beat with heavy 808 bass and rolling hi-hats, aggressive vocals with auto-tune, modern production,
ominous atmosphere, Atlanta influence, contemporary hip-hop with melodic elements
```
✅ **Good:**
```
dark trap, 808-heavy, rolling hi-hats, aggressive, modern
```
### 2. **Conflicting Style Tags**
❌ **Bad:**
```
Style: smooth jazz, aggressive metal, peaceful, chaotic
```
✅ **Good:**
```
Style: smooth jazz, mellow, sophisticated, evening vibes
```
### 3. **Ignoring Character Limits**
❌ **Bad:**
Writing 10 verses with extensive descriptions (4000+ characters)
✅ **Good:**
2-3 verses, chorus, bridge within 3000 characters
### 4. **Too Many Nested Brackets**
❌ **Bad:**
```
[VERSE 1 [aggressive] [fast tempo] [808s]]
```
✅ **Good:**
```
[VERSE 1]
[aggressive, fast tempo, 808-heavy]
```
### 5. **Vague Style Descriptions**
❌ **Bad:**
```
Style: good music, nice vibes, cool sound
```
✅ **Good:**
```
Style: boom-bap, jazzy samples, lo-fi, introspective
```
### 6. **Not Using Exclusions**
❌ **Bad:**
Making country music and getting trap drums mixed in
✅ **Good:**
```
Exclusions: 808s, trap, electronic, urban
```
### 7. **Extreme Slider Settings Without Purpose**
❌ **Bad:**
100% weirdness on traditional country expecting normal results
✅ **Good:**
30% weirdness for traditional country to maintain genre conventions
### 8. **Forgetting Song Structure**
❌ **Bad:**
Just writing lyrics with no [VERSE], [CHORUS] tags
✅ **Good:**
Clear structure with proper tags guiding the AI
### 9. **Inconsistent Tone Between Lyrics and Style**
❌ **Bad:**
- Lyrics about heartbreak and loss
- Style: upbeat, happy, celebratory
✅ **Good:**
- Lyrics about heartbreak
- Style: melancholic, slow tempo, emotional
### 10. **Not Experimenting Enough**
Don't stick to default settings. Try:
- Different weirdness levels
- Various style combinations
- Multiple generations
- Slider extremes occasionally

## Advanced Techniques
### Creating Song Series/Continuations
Use consistent style boxes and similar lyrics structure:
**Part 1:**
```
[VERSE 1]
This is my story, chapter one begins
[Continue with story]
```
**Part 2:**
```
[VERSE 1]
Chapter two unfolds as the story continues
[Reference Part 1 events]
```

**Trap-Jazz:**
```
Style: trap beats, jazz piano, 808s, smooth saxophone, atmospheric
Weirdness: 55%
Style Influence: 50%
```
**Country-Hip Hop:**
```
Style: country rap, banjo, 808s, twangy vocals, modern production
Weirdness: 60%
Style Influence: 45%
```
### Dynamic Vocal Direction
Change delivery throughout:
```
[VERSE 1]
[smooth, conversational]
Starting calm here
[VERSE 2]
[building intensity]
Energy increasing
[VERSE 3]
[aggressive, passionate delivery]
Maximum intensity here
```
### Creating Atmosphere
Use non-lyrical elements:
```
[INTRO]
[ambient rain sounds, distant thunder, piano entering slowly]
[OUTRO]
[echoing vocals, fade to silence with lingering reverb]
```
