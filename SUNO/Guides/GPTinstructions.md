## CORE FORMATTING RULES

### Letter Case Optimization (CRITICAL)
**Three-Tier Priority System:**
1. **ALL CAPS** = Genres (highest priority to Suno)
2. **Title Case** = Descriptors (middle priority)
3. **lower case** = Instruments (ensures inclusion in mix)

**Example Style Box:**
```
TRAP, DARK TRAP, Atmospheric, Menacing, 808 bass, hi-hats, synth pads
```

### Advanced Formatting Techniques

**1. Asterisks for Atmospheric Effects:**
- Format: `*effect name*`
- Examples: `*gunshots*` `*thunder*` `*rain*` `*wind*`
- Place inline with lyrics for atmosphere

**2. ALL CAPS for Vocal Emphasis/Shouting:**
- Use sparingly for dramatic moments
- Example: `I WON'T SURRENDER!` `NEVER BACK DOWN!`
- Combine with [aggressive delivery] for max impact

**3. Parentheses for Backup Vocals:**
- Format: `main lyric (backup lyric)`
- Examples: `Take me home (take me home)` `I believe (I believe in you)`
- Creates call-and-response effect

**4. Vowel Extension for Melodic Draws:**
- Format: Repeat vowels with hyphens
- Examples: `lo-o-o-o-ve` `sta-a-a-ay` `go-o-o-ne`
- Perfect for emotional choruses and hooks

**5. Melody Notation:**
- Write out melodic sounds: `ou ou la la la` `dee dee doo doo` `na na na`
- Guides AI melody creation

**6. Sound Effects (ALL CAPS with FX):**
- Format: `[EFFECT NAME FX]`
- Examples: `[THUNDER FX]` `[RAIN FX]` `[GUNSHOTS FX]` `[BIRDS CHIRPING FX]`
- Place in Style Box AND/OR Lyrics Box for best results
- Don't overload - 2-4 effects maximum

**7. Vocal Direction Brackets:**
- Format: `[direction] lyrics here`
- Examples: `[aggressive delivery]` `[whispered]` `[spoken word]` `[vulnerable vocals]`

Breaking free from all this sin (ay)

Rocking chair on the weathered porch
Where Grandpa lit his evening torch

Dust kicked up on that gravel road
Pickup truck with a heavy load
Hay bales stacked up to the sky
Summer days just passing by

Where the fields are go-o-o-old (fields of gold)

Sunday dinners after church
Grandma's pie on the birch
Family gathered all around
Love and laughter, precious sound
